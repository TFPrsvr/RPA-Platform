Always exclude outside references including Claude. Do not commit, push, or anything with the outside references.



When making a new branch always create from either main or develop so it automatically pushed \& merged into main or the one the repo is set up to be the default.



Always put docs that go with projects into a separate folder that contains all docs. Always separate headers, subheaders, subtitles, comments, etc with different fonts, font sizes, \& colors according to importance. Insert graphs as an actual graph or tables as an actual table. Add emoji's that are relevant to correct sections. Keep subfolders for future developers, business (user-non-tech-users) users, Necessary info, Config's, Integrations \& Implementations, etc



After a push or PR create a new branch off the correct branch to push into. Do a overhaul on docs, files, folders, etc.  make sure everything is imported, exported correctly, all functions, dependencies with or without arrays are complete \& used. Get rid of any un-necessary files, folders. Check everything that could be possible to make it not build or have errors. Fix any problems. While fixing don't erase files to just have to recreate them. Only erase if truly is not needed and or is temporary.



Always check for things that might be missing or not thought of. Like if you have to have one part of something done to open another part make sure it checks to see if done then automatically opens up the previously closed part. Be pre-emptive on easier functionality and accessibility.



Make sure all projects are touch, keyboard, mouse, etc responsive so they are truly mobile friendly.



Make sure all projects have mbl/tablet responsiveness that is aesthetically pleasing to the human eye. Symetrical.



Always keeps all names for files, folders, subfolders, etc so that they are understandable to be able to have a new person come in and know or make it easy to figure out the structure or the flow of your code. Keep all code up to date with acceptable \& standard coding practices. Keep all code, files, folders, subfolders in a professional manner in style \& behavior
